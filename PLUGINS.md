# Notes for plugin authors

A plugin can be an object with one or more of the following fields: `atrule`, `filter` `set` and `sink` or an array of zero or more plugins (nested arrays are thus supported).

The plugins can only be registered when a j2c instance is created using `var j2c = new J2c({plugins: [plugin1, ...]})

## Overview of the types of plugins

`j2c` is at heart a simple compiler made of a frontend and a backend. 

- The frontend that walks a tree made of objects and arrays (as if it were an AST) and calls the backend when necessary to emit atrules, rules and declarations.

- A backend is made of a sink and optional filters. Filters intercept and modify the values sent to the sink. The default backend is made of a sink that fills a buffer with strings and `join()`s them on completion. 

`j2c` plugin can either tap into the frontend (by implementing custom at-rules), and replace the sink, augment it with filters and/or set additional properties and methods on the instance.

## `set` plugins: set additional properties and methods on the instance.

A `set` plugin is an object with a `set` property whose value is an object. The keys and values of that last object will be copied onto the instance that is being built using a `_.defaults()` semantics, meaning that native `j2c` methods can't be overwritten. If there are more than one `set` plugin, they are processed from the last to the first one, so the properties of the last plugin will prevail on those of the previous ones.

## `sink` plugins: replace the very end of the backend

A `j2c` backend must provide the following API:

```JS
{
    init() {},
    // called on `j2c.sheet()/j2c.inline()` invocations before 
    // the sheet is processed.
    done() {},
    // when the tree traversal is finished, to finalize
    // the style sheet
    err(message) {},
    // when an error is noticed, allows to display errors
    // in context.
    raw(txt) {},
    // inserts `txt` as is into the buffer
    decl(property, value),
    // inserts a declaration into the sheet
    rule(selector) {},
    // opens a rule with a given selector. At this point in the pipeline,
    // the selector is fully formed. Class names have been localized and
    // nested selectors have been merged.
    _rule() {},
    // signals the end of a ruleset
    atrule(name, kind, param, block)
    // when an atrule is encountered.
    // `name` is the rule name in full includin the '@' and the
    // prefix when there's one. e.g. '@-webkit-keyframes'
    // `kind` is the type of at-rule, without '@' nor prefix
    // e.g. 'keyframes'
    // `param` is the optional parameter
    // `block` is a tells whether the at-rule takes a block or
    // not. Values:
    //  - falsy for @namespace, @charset and @import
    //  - 'decl' if the block contains declarations like @font-face
    //  - 'rule' if the block contains rules like @media or @keyframes
    _atrule(){}
    // called to signal the end of an atrule block
}
```

`j2c.inline()` uses the same API but restricted to `init()`, `done()`, `err(msg)` and `decl(property, value)`.

As mentioned above, The default sink pushes the various arguments into a buffer and `.join()`s it on `done()` and returns the resulting string. Smarter sinks that deduplicate rules or insert them one at a time using sheet.insertRule() on the fly for speed.

A filter plugin is an object with a `sink` property whose value is a function that returns an array of one or two backends. The first backend is intended for `j2c.sheet()`, the second, optional, for `j2c.inline()`. In the absence of a second sink `j2c` creates one out of the methods of the first one (`init`, `done`, `err`, `raw` and `decl`).
The function is called once when a `j2c` instance is created.

### Example

The following sink will produce a string with CSS indented by 4 spaces:

```JS
export const prettySink = {sink: function(){
  var buf, err, indent
  return [{
    init: function(){buf=[], err=0, indent = ''},
    done: function (raw) {
      if (err) throw new Error('j2c error, see below\n' + buf.join(''))
      return raw ? buf : buf.join('')
    },
    err: function(msg) {
      err = 1
      buf.push('/* +++ ERROR +++ ' + msg + ' */\n')
    },
    raw: function(txt) {
      buf.push(txt, '\n')
    },
    atrule: function(rule, kind, param, takesBlock) {
      buf.push(indent, rule, param && ' ', param, takesBlock ? ' {' : ';', '\n')
      if (takesBlock) indent = indent + '    '
    },
    // close atrule
    _atrule: function() {
      indent = indent.slice(4)
      buf.push(indent, '}', '\n')
    },
    rule: function(selector) {
      buf.push(indent, selector, ' {', '\n')
      indent = indent + '    '
    },

    // close rule
    _rule: function() {
      indent = indent.slice(4)
      buf.push(indent, '}', '\n')
    },
    decl: function (prop, value) {buf.push(indent, prop, prop && ': ', value, ';', '\n')}
  }]
}}
```

## `filter` plugins: augment a backend.

Be sure to read the `sink` section first. Understanding the `sink` API is necessary to write `filter` plugins.

A filter plugin receive the next backend as an arguement and return a new one, augmented with some capabilites. The filter methods must call the methods of the backend it recieved as an arguement. The methods are optional. When a method is missing `j2c` automatically defers to the next one.

It is made of an object with a `filter` property whose value is a function that takes two parameters: `next` and `inline`. `next` is the next part of the backend (a `sink`, possibly augmented by previous filters). `inline` is truthy for `j2c.inlne()` filters and falsy for `j2c.sheet()` filters. The plugin function is called twice when the `j2c` instance is created, once for `inline` and once for `sheet`. The fields of its return value should not be mutated once the wrapper function has returned.

Example

Here's a simple filter that makes each declaration `!important`

```JS
export const importantFilter = {filter: function(next) {
    return {
        decl: function(prop, value) {
            next.decl(
                prop,
                /!important$/.test(value) 
                ? value 
                : value + ' !important'
            )
        }
    }
}}
```

Calling the next methods rather than returning values has advantages and drawbacks. On the pro side:

- it allows to forward more than one value without allocating anything on the heap.
- it allows to call the next method several times (the prefix plugin, turns `flex-flow:...` into `-webkit-box-direction:...` plus `-webkit-box-orient:...` by calling `next.decl()` twice, for example).
- it allows to buffer the calls and re-create an AST, as done by the PostCSS plugin. The various methods of the filter build a tree. On `done()`, the PostCSS processor is called and the resulting tree is walked. The walkers then call the `next.x` handlers.
- The functions are generally small and can be inlined by the JIT compilers. Unless it materializes the AST as the PostCSS plugin does, the engine iterates only once over the source tree.

The main drawback is that it allows one to call the `next` functions in an incorrect order and to produce an invalid style sheet.

## `atrule` plugins.

**WIP (TODO document the `declarations()` and `rules()` and `state.localizeReplacer` functions)**

`atrule` plugins allow one to handle custom at-rules that take precedence over the default ones.

An `atrule` plugin is an object with a `atrule` property whose value is a function with the following signature:

```JS
function atrulePlugin(
    state,
    backend,
    rule,
    argOrBlock,
    selectorPrefix,
    local,
    nestingDepth
):bool {}
```

If it should return `true` if it handled the rule it was given and `false` otherwise.

- `state` contains the state-related functions and properties of the `j2c` instance. a `localize()` method that registers a new local name an returns it mangled, a `localizeReplacer` used as a second argument to `aString.replace(regexp, replacer)` and a `names` object that contains the plain => mangled local names mapping. It also holds an array with the at-rules plugins.

- `backend` is the backend whose methods are described in the `sink` section.

- `[match, name, kind, param] = rule` is an array, the result of a regexp match. For example, `"@-webkit-keyframes foo"` will map to `["@-webkit-keyframes foo", "@-webkit-keyframes", "keyframes", "foo"]`, and `"@namespace"` will map to `["@namespace", "@namespace", "namespace", ""]`.

- `argOrBlock` is either the argument for at-rules that don't take blocks: `@import`, `@namespace` and `@charset`, or the nested block for rules that take one (all of the others).

- `selectorPrefix` is the selector at this point in the tree. Since `j2c` supports nested selectors and at-rules, the final selector emitted by `backend.rule()` may be longer, augmented by sub-selectors defined in the `argOrBlock` sub-tree.

- `local` is a boolean true when we are in local scope, false otherwise

- `nestingDepth` is a number that reflects how deep we are in the tree. 0 at the root, then incremented at each level. Arrays in the tree don't increment the depth.
